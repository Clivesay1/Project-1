# Analysis Goals
We intend to use the data from the Department of Labor to figure out the Median household income of families in TN. As well as the median cost of childcare for these families. Then we will calculate the total cost per child to determine what percentage of income is utilized towards childcare. This information can be used to set healthy financial goals for prospective parents as well as encouraging budgeting for others.
